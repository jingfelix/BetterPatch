# BetterPatch

BetterPatch is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to enhance the display of diff format files.

## Features

1. **Diff-Hunk-level Folding**: betterpatch allows each Diff and Hunk in a diff file to be folded, making it easier for you to view and manage diff files.

2. **Diff-Hunk-level Outlining**: betterpatch also adds an outline for each Diff and Hunk, allowing you to quickly locate the Hunk you want to view in the outline view.

## Known Issues

~~Outlining should be built from different levels of patches, but currently, it is built from the hunk level. This will be improved in the future.~~
