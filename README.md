# BetterPatch README

BetterPatch is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to enhance the display of diff format files.

## Features

1. **Hunk-level Folding**: betterpatch allows each Hunk in a diff file to be folded, making it easier for you to view and manage diff files.

2. **Hunk-level Outlining**: betterpatch also adds an outline for each Hunk, allowing you to quickly locate the Hunk you want to view in the outline view.

## Known Issues

Outlining should be built from different levels of patches, but currently, it is built from the hunk level. This will be improved in the future.
